# Example container repository configuration

This example is designed to be used in the [cloud-platform-environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments) repository.

## Usage

In your namespace's `resources/` directory in the [cloud-platform-environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/) repository, create a file called `ecr.tf`, and copy the contents of [main.tf](main.tf) into it.

Change the placeholder values to what is appropriate based on the inline comments, and refer to the top-level [README](../README.md) in this repository for other variables that you can use to customise your resource.
